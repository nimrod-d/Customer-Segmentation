# Customer-Segmentation

# Customer Segmentation Project

## Introduction
This project applies KMeans clustering to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographics. The goal is to provide actionable insights for targeted marketing and customer retention.

## Data and Methods
- **Dataset**: Customer purchase and demographic data
- **Methods**: Data preprocessing, PCA for dimensionality reduction, KMeans clustering
- **Models Used**: KMeans for clustering, potential use of KNN for future data classification

## Key Findings
### Cluster Insights and Action Plans
- **Cluster 1**: [Insight summary and action plan]
- **Cluster 2**: [Insight summary and action plan]
- **Cluster 3**: [Insight summary and action plan]
- **Cluster 4**: [Insight summary and action plan]
